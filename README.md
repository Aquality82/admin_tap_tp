# Admin Tap Tp

A simple gmod addon that teleports the player to where their cursor looks at. Useful for admins that wanna reach a certain point faster.

This addon only tps the player under the condition of them noclipping only. Meaning that anyone with noclip on have the ability, however, soon ill implement a custom check utility that 
lets you customize how the addon works

In order to set your own keybind, type "cursortp_setbind" in console and the button you want to bind it with. Currently it only works with keyboard buttons only. The default button is "]".
